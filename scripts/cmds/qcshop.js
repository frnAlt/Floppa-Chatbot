👒🐇 Grillby's has food, and the library has information...
👒🐇 If you're tired, you can take a nap at the inn. It's right next door - my sister runs it.
👒🐇 And if you're bored, you can sit outside and watch those wacky skeletons do their thing.`,
        `👒🐇 There's two of 'em... Brothers, I think. They just showed up one day and... ... asserted themselves.
👒🐇 The town has gotten a lot more interesting since then.`,

👒🐇 A long time ago, monsters lived in the RUINS back there in the forest.
👒🐇 Long story short, we all decided to leave the ruins and head for the end of the caverns.
👒🐇 Along the way, some fuzzy folk decided they liked the cold and set up camp in Snowdin.`,
        `👒🐇 Oh, and don't think about trying to explore the RUINS...
The door's been locked for ages. 👒🐇 So unless you're a ghost or can burrow under the door, forget about it.`,

👒🐇 A little claustrophobic...
👒🐇 But... we all know deep down that freedom is coming, don't we?
👒🐇 As long as we got that hope, we can grit our teeth and face the same struggles, day after day...
👒🐇 That's life, ain't it?`,
